Programming and Software Development

As part of my undergraduate curriculum, I’ve taken classes in Visual Basic, C++ and MATLAB.  A large part of my current position involves using SQL to extract data and perform data analysis on it, usually in Excel.  However, since I’ve taken classes on R, Python and SQL as part of my curriculum for my M.S. in Data Science, I’m starting to use R and Python a lot more at work.  It also happens that my department has begun to shift towards R and Python usage, and I’ve helped some of my colleagues get up and running with these programs.  Additionally, I’ve recently begun to learn SAS Enterprise Guide to supplement some of my SQL query-based tasks, and learned Tableau for visualizations.  In my upcoming fall semester, I’ll have classes on Machine Learning and Data Viz, which I’m looking forward to learning and incorporating into my skill set.
